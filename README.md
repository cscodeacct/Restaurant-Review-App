## Project Overview: 

The Developer is expected to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, He/She will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. He/She will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Description

The Developer is provided with Starter Kit (the code) for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. The Developer's job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### Requirements

Python is required
Web accessibilty is required
Responsiveness

### Steps to begin

1. Download the Starter Kit GitHub zip file or clone the repository onto your computer:
https://cscodeacct.github.io/Restaurant-Review-App 

2. Open a terminal in your computer with Admin right, check the version of Python you have by passing the following command: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. When the server is started, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` to view the  Restaurant Review App.

4. Open index.html file to launch the App [here](https://cscodeacct.github.io/Restaurant-Review-App)
